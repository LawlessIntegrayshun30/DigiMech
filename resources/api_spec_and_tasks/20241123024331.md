## Full API spec



## Shared Knowledge

'diagnostics.py' contains Diagnostics class which is central to the application, interacting with NLPProcessor, KnowledgeBase, and OBDInterface classes.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It is unclear how the AI will handle the vast range of vehicle models and the specificities of their OBDII systems. Further research on compatibility and standardization is needed. Additionally, the scope of automatic repairs that can be performed by the AI directly on the vehicle's computer is not defined. This requires further clarification on the technical and legal limitations.
