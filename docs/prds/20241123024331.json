{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Develop an Ai model that will be used in application for diagnosing and repairing / recommending repairs for automobiles.  This model should be able to take user inputs, such as descriptions of vehicle symptoms, data or a direct data feed from the vehicle's OBDII port and use it's knowledgebase and internet research to suggest possible repairs or if it is inside the automobile's computer, make the necessary changes to repair the vehicle.","Project Name":"auto_diagnostic_ai","Product Goals":["Create an AI model that accurately diagnoses vehicle issues","Ensure the AI model can interface with OBDII for real-time diagnostics","Develop a user-friendly application that provides repair recommendations"],"User Stories":["As a car owner, I want to describe my car's symptoms and receive a diagnosis","As a mechanic, I want to connect to a car's OBDII port and get repair suggestions","As a user, I want the system to automatically perform repairs if possible"],"Competitive Analysis":["AutoMD: User-friendly but does not support direct OBDII data feed","CarMD: Supports OBDII but with limited diagnosis capabilities","FIXD: Good OBDII support, but lacks comprehensive repair suggestions","OBD Auto Doctor: Robust OBDII diagnostics, but not AI-driven","Torque Pro: Advanced OBDII features, but no AI for automatic repairs"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"AI Diagnostic Capabilities and User Experience\"\n    x-axis \"Basic Diagnostic\" --> \"Advanced Diagnostic\"\n    y-axis \"Poor User Experience\" --> \"Excellent User Experience\"\n    quadrant-1 \"Basic and Unfriendly\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Advanced but Unfriendly\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Basic but Friendly\"\n    quadrant-4 \"Advanced and Friendly\"\n    \"AutoMD\": [0.2, 0.7]\n    \"CarMD\": [0.6, 0.5]\n    \"FIXD\": [0.7, 0.6]\n    \"OBD Auto Doctor\": [0.8, 0.4]\n    \"Torque Pro\": [0.8, 0.3]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.9, 0.8]","Requirement Analysis":"The AI model must be capable of understanding natural language descriptions of vehicle issues, interpreting OBDII diagnostic data, and accessing a knowledgebase or the internet for research. It should also be able to execute repairs within the vehicle's computer when possible. User experience is crucial, as the application must be accessible to both car owners and mechanics.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Develop an AI model capable of natural language processing for symptom description interpretation"],["P0","Implement OBDII port connectivity and data analysis features"],["P0","Create a knowledgebase for common vehicle issues and solutions"],["P1","Design a user interface that is intuitive for non-technical users"],["P2","Enable the AI to perform automatic repairs on the vehicle's computer"]],"UI Design draft":"The application will have a simple and clean interface, with a prominent feature for users to input or describe their vehicle symptoms. There will also be a section for mechanics to view and interpret OBDII data, along with suggested repairs. Automatic repair options will be clearly indicated where available.","Anything UNCLEAR":"It is unclear how the AI will handle the vast range of vehicle models and the specificities of their OBDII systems. Further research on compatibility and standardization is needed."}
